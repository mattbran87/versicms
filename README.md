## What is Versi CMS

## Versi Goals
Versi CMS is inspired by the need of small business clients that only need the ability to make small edits to the site and a development framework for developers to create informational sites as fast as possible. WordPress, the most popular CMS framework, can satisfy most needs of developers for small to medium sized websites but, in my experience, can be too much for a client to manage.
